# pt2025-tictactoe

# Guidelines:
- This is a CLI application that allows two players to play the famous tictactoe / alu cross game on their terminal
- Try to implement best practices in code reusability, proper code organization and strict typing.
- Create a branch off this repo and create a detailed PR. The PR should have a description of your POV while architecting the app. A screencast with voice doing a walkthrough will be much appreciated.
- Remember *DRY* and *KISS*
- Make sure to validate user responses. Never trust any input without proper validation:)
